- Target distribution: report the cancellation rate and whether class balance is skewed.
- Highest missing-rate columns: list the top columns and propose imputation strategies.
- Strongest categorical patterns: summarize influential group differences (hotel, deposit type, segment).
- Numeric distributions: describe skewness/outliers for lead_time and adr; justify clipping/robust preprocessing.
- Seasonality: summarize changes in cancellation rate across arrival months.
- Data quality notes: document suspicious values and handling decisions.
- Preprocessing plan: median imputation for numeric, most_frequent for categorical, one-hot encoding for categoricals.
- Scaling policy: required for KNN/LogReg; not required for Tree/RF.
